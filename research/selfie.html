                I have passed by the Davis Centennial Seal many times but I have never looked at it closely. When I looked at it closer I foud my eyes kept being drawn to the section about the city's connection to UC Davis. This is probably because my connection to the town is through the school, so all the iconography in this section was familiar to me. I was impressed with the artists ability to represent the school in just a few images.
