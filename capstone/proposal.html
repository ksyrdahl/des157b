                Project Proposal 
            </h1>
            <p>
                My topic for the project is the donated bricks surrounding the seal and therefore my target audience would be the people who have donated bricks or been assigned a brick. I was not planning to work with a partner because I think the topic is for the most part straightforward. However, if someone is interested in the same project as me, I wouldn't mind working with someone especially if they have a strong background in coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my project features would be that it would have a map of all the bricks that users can zoom in and out of and also scroll to different areas of the map. This feature would allow the user to explore and click on different bricks to see who they belong to. Another main feature would be a search bar so users can search for their brick directly instead of needing to click on each individual brick. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My main concern with this project is how to illustrate the map of the bricks in an interesting way that is easy to understand but also isn't so simple that it looks like a bunch of squares. I will also need to consider if the map design can be used on mobile because this is the format my target audience will be most likely to use.
