            <h2>Interview Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                From my interviews I learned that the people in my target audience can be from a wide background. Brian is originally from New Jersey and Kim is originally from Malaysia. This means that the people who donated bricks did not necessarily grow up in Davis or even grow up in the United States. This means that I need to be considerate about the backgrounds of the people visiting my site. However, they have both lived in Davis for a long time, about 16 years. This shows that even if they have different life experiences, one thing that unites them all is they've had good experiences in Davis because if they had mostly negative  ones they probably wouldn't be donating a brick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else I noticed is that Kim and Brian are both well educated. Kim has a degree in nursing and works as a psychiatric nurse while Brian has a PhD in psychiatry. However, just because two people from my target audience have degrees doesn't mean everyone in my target audience will have a higher education. Though it is a possibility since it would be hard to make enough money to buy a house in Davis without higher education. This means that my target audience might appreciate a website that has a higher education feel or style to it because it would bring a sense of familiarity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally one of the things that both Kim and Brian emphasized is their love for the arts and music in Davis. Brian said that for such a small town there is so much art and culture. I think it makes sense that my target audience would be lovers of art since they wanted to be part of putting together the Davis Centennial Seal which is a large art piece. Because of this I want to create an artistic feeling to the map as well. I do not want the design to distract from the purpose of the map but I also want to create something that complements the beautiful artistry of the Davis Centennial Seal.

            <p>
                I also asked about their confidence with using technology and said they feel pretty confident which was surprising to me because they are from an older audience. However, they did say they prefer to not use technology most of the time. This means that I will have to work to make my website appealing to an audience that is not necessarily as keen on technology.
