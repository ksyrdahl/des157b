                Paper Prototype

            <p>
               I didn't notice any obvious complications in the testing. I belive this is because there are few interactions that users can make on my website compared to something like a game. However, to make the interactions even more obvious I can add instructions directly on the website or create a help button that walks people through a tutorial of interactions they can make on the website. I think the most difficult part will be the dragging and zooming function on the map but this is difficult to simulate in paper format so I will have to wait and see if there are complications after I have a coded protoype of the project.
