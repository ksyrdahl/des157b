                    Plan for update
                </h2>
                <p>
                   I plan to add a button of a map in the bottom left corner of the screen so users can return to the full map once they have clicked on a section. My idea for how I would code this, is I will have the button reload the entire page on click. Then for the search bar I plan to organize the names in alphabetical order since I learned that people search through the names first before using the search bar. Then to solve the issue that the Mishkas and Hunteboyer logo looks like a button, I plan to make the opacity lower so it blends in more to the background and looks less like a clickable button.

                <h2>
                    Observation 1
                </h2>
                <p>
                   The main observation that I noticed was that I didn't have a way for users to return to the main map once they go to a section. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Observation 2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the search bar I noticed that with both of my users they first go to the list of names in the search instead of using the search bar which was interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Observation 3
                </h2>
                <p>
                   I also noticed that people are drawn to clicking on the Mishkas and Hunterboyer logo. I was worried about this because it does kind of look like a button.
