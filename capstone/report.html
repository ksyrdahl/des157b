            <h3>An Interactive Map</h3>
                <p>I plan to map out the donated bricks surrounding the seal.</p>
            <h3>Interact on Click</h3>
                <p>The map will be interactive on click. If a user clicks on a brick it will  highlight the brick clicked and create a small pop up that shows who donated that specific brick. Users can close out of the pop up and the brick will stay highlighted until they click another brick.</p>
            <h3>A Search Bar</h3>
                <p>They will be a search bar that allows users to search their name to find their brick. The search bar will draw data from a file with all of the names of donors and provide an autofill for the bricks.</p>
            <h3>Zoom In and Out</h3>
                <p>I want users to be able to zoom in and out of the map so they can explore the map and use it to orient themselves.</p>

                    I was planning to use an image map for the interactive map but then I realized I couldn't use the zoom feature if I did this  so instead I plan to place an svg of my map in the background and place invisible divs on top of the image. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the search bar I still need to do more research to find a good library to help me create the search bar or find a tutorial to create the search bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the zoom in and out feature I need to play around with how to best code this. I also want to learn how to use the drag feature so that once the user zooms they can move the map like on google maps. 
                </p>
            <h2>Skill Assesment</h2>
                <p>
                    I think most of the things I want to do with the project I already have the skills to make a basic version of those interactions. If I have time I can maybe do something more advanced but if not I will stick to the simple version. I think the thing I am the most worried about is the search bar. However, if the search bar ends up being out of my skill set I have the idea of adding a separate page where there is a list of names alphabetically that users can search for their name the old fashioned way.
