                    The main purpose of this article is to show how important it is to preserve the greenways of an area, specifically in Davis. This resource shows how proactive Davis was in preserving nature and parks in the city and some of the tactics they used to successfully do this. There was not much information on the author himself but the article is from a larger collection of work from the International Linear Parks Conference. This conference is centered around preserving and improving parks in different cities.

                    The author concludes that the people of Davis value the natural environment and as the city's population increases it is important to preserve the green ways and not completely cover the city with housing. I think that this article is an interesting artifact from time because it shows that compared to other cities Daivs was successful with preserving their green ways as there are many parks spread out through Davis despite it being such a small city.

                    The main purpose of this work is to give a historical chronological timeline on the architecture in the City of Davis starting from when it was inhabited by the Native Americans to Modern-day Davis (2015). The resource compares buildings through photographs and references to other material. They discuss which buildings have changed and which are still standing today such as the Varsity Theater. This resource is useful in showing how the aesthetic of Davis has changed overtime and how the inhabitants have influenced styles in Davis.

                    The author has an educational background in history with a degree from Sacramento State and UCLA. She has written multiple papers with an emphasis on the historical significance of buildings and has nominated multiple buildings to be part of the National Register for Historic Places. The author concludes that there are many different architectural styles in Davis for such a small town, and that this is in part due to the diverse population the Daivs has had through the years. I believe that this is because despite Davis being such a small town it attracts many different types of people as a result of the University.

                    The main purpose of this article is to showcase the history of biking in the city of Davis. This resource shows how important and central biking is to the community of Davis but also how its popularity has decreased in recent years. The authors have a background as part of the community of Davis as well as a degree with an emphasis in transportation studies and a degree in environmental studies.

                    The authors conclude that there has been a decrease in the advocacy for biking in the community and a decrease in biking programs. They believe that if the community reinstates some of these old programs that there might be an increase in biking again. I also believe if they want to increase the amount of biking, something they could implement is a location for people to fix their bikes or fill their tires. I know that some apartment complexes in Davis provide these kinds of locations but most of them are neglected and not usable. If there are more of these stations then more people might be likely to bike.
